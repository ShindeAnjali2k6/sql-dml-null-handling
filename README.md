# SQL Practice: Insert, Update, Delete Operations

This project demonstrates basic SQL operations such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` using a small relational database for an e-commerce scenario.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Oracle SQL*Plus (also compatible with DB Fiddle / SQLiteStudio)
- SQL

## 📋 Tables Created
- `Customers`
- `Products`
- `Orders`
- `OrderDetails`

## 📦 Sample Operations

### ✅ INSERT
Data is inserted into each table. Some entries intentionally include `NULL` values to demonstrate missing data handling.

### 🔄 UPDATE
NULL values are updated to default values using `UPDATE` statements.

### ❌ DELETE
Specific records are deleted safely, respecting foreign key constraints.

## 📁 Files Included
- `insert_update_delete_clean.sql` — Contains all the `CREATE`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` SQL statements.
